B"H

I use it to collect all my dotfiles, bash aliases and functions i use frequently also `.vimrc` etc.. <br>
So whenever i use new computer or vm on regular base i just clone this repo to `$HOME`, source it and here i have my custom shell commands aliases and prompt.

To use it:
Clone the this repository to your `$HOME` diractory.
And run the command below.
```bash
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile or both if you not sure.
cat dotfiles/add_to_dot_bash >> .bashrc
```
