B"H

I use it to collect all my dotfiles (.bash..., .vimrc, etc..) <br>
So whenever i use new computer or vm on regular base i just clone this repo to $HOME, source it and here i have my custom shell commands aliases and prompt.

Run the command below 
```bash
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile or both if you not sure.
cat dotfiles/add_to_dot_bash >> .bashrc
```
